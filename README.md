## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Instant Definitions:** Select any word to get instant dictionary meanings
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI:** Modern, minimal, and accessible design with React + Tailwind CSS
- 🚀 **Fast & Lightweight:** Built with performance and low resource usage in mind
- 🔒 **Privacy-Focused:** Works entirely offline after setup; no data collection
- 🌐 **Universal Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across all websites
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation:** Use ↑/↓ arrows to browse word history
- 📚 **Word History:** Automatically saves and displays recent lookups
- 🤖 **AI Context Mode:** Optional BYOK Gemini explanations for the selected word's local sentence context

### AI Mode and privacy

Dictionary Mode continues to use the Free Dictionary API. AI Mode is opt-in and sends only the selected word plus up to 2,000 characters of nearby sentence/paragraph context directly to Google's Gemini API over HTTPS. It does not intentionally send entire pages, browsing history, cookies, or unrelated metadata.

SuperBook uses a bring-your-own-key model: you enter your own Gemini API key when enabling AI Mode. The key is stored in `chrome.storage.local`, is never logged or sent anywhere except the fixed Gemini endpoint, and is removed by the Remove API key control. Local extension storage is not a server-side secret: a user or local software with access to the browser profile can inspect it. Do not commit keys to source control.

The configured model is `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, centralized in the MV3 service worker. Gemini's own processing and retention are governed by Google's current API terms; SuperBook makes no claim that third-party providers retain no data.

   ```

   ```
   chrome://extensions/

---

## 🛠️ Development Setup

Before starting, ensure you have **Node.js (v16 or higher)** installed.
We recommend using **pnpm** — a fast, disk-efficient package manager.

### 💡 Why pnpm?

`pnpm` is a next-generation package manager that:

- 🚀 **Installs dependencies faster** by using a global content-addressable store
- 💾 **Saves disk space** — shared packages aren’t duplicated across projects
- ⚡ **Improves performance** with efficient caching and linking
- 🧩 **Maintains strict version control**, ensuring consistent builds

In short, it’s **faster**, **leaner**, and **more reliable** than traditional npm installs.

---

### 📦 Install pnpm (if not already installed)

You can install pnpm globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

To verify the installation:

```bash
pnpm -v
```

You should see the version number (e.g., `9.0.0` or later).

---

### 🧰 Setup Steps

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SuperBook.git
   cd SuperBook
   ```

2. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies using pnpm**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Start local development (demo site)**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **Build and test your changes**

   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

## 🧭 Notes on Architecture

- The extension runtime (MV3) assets live under `public/background/`, `public/content/`, and `public/styles/`, referenced by `public/manifest.json`.
- The popup’s canonical entry is `public/popup.html`. The alternate `public/popup-terminal.html` is retained for reference.
- The React demo app under `src/` showcases the tooltip UX (`DictionaryDemo` + `DictionaryTooltip`) and is separate from the extension popup.
